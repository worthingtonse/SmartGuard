# SmartGuard
A module written in 'C" that stops DDOS attacks and intrusion using AI

This project is waiting to begin. 

## Project Description
Intrusion detection and DDOS attacks attempt to bring down servers by overloading them with unnecessary requests. These attacks are very easy to detect by people as we can see patterns and recognize what attackers are doing.

However, creating software that is able to detect attacks is not so simple. No matter what patters we make the software look for, attackers seem to be able to come up with ways around them. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a general solution that would work on all servers. Many solutions today add overhead to request handling to the point that the systems slow down defeating the whole point of preventing intrusions and DDOS. Also, systems may lockout legitimate traffic and actually case system unavailability. 


## 1. Questions or problems we wish to address:
Can AI be used in high performance systems to efficiently stop DDOS attacks and detect intruders?

## 2. Description of methodologies. 
We want to implement a AI into our current DDOS systems and see if it works at high speeds. 
However, first we must create such a system. This system will be written in C language, Rust or both. We will need to learn about how much computing power is needed to power the AI and try to reduce it to the minimum. We may also look at programming using CUDA to further enhance the performance. 

## 3. Expected results of the project
We expect to have a "Module" that can be plugged into any networking program that will accept code written in C. This module will detect DDOS and intruders and act as directed. 


We will work on such intrusion detection systems that attempts to quickly identify and stop intruders and DDOS with minimum server resources dedicated to this task.  

We will make this project open source and available to the public on GitHub.com. The computer languages will be either 'C', Rust or both.
